How to run our project:

All folders have .py file used to GET tweets/data using nltk_*_collect.py

CLASS_training: builds classifier model (categories.nb) using classifier.py. 

CLASS_dev: contains categories.nb model and nbtest.py used to determine accuracy/precision/recall/F-Score.

CLASS_test: runs same nbtest.py and categories.nb model on random tweets and determines which tweet belongs to which category.
